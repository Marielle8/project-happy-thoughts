# Happy Thoughts

This is a project I made during the Technigo bootcamp.

The project was about practicing React state by fetching and posting data to an API.
and how to use the useEffect hook in React.
## The problem

I made a trelloboard on the project when I was almost done just to make sure that I had done all the requirments and also to make sure that I had done everything that I wanted to do with the styling. I approached this project by taking part of recorded videos where the projects structure was described. I tried to listen to the videos first and then start to coding by myself but after a short time I decided to code along instead since it was new information on how to write some parts of the code like useEffect and also how and where you should store the API. I managed to do most of the project myself whit help from the videos. The things I couldn't solve I got help with in my team. For example how to get the message I sent on top of the list insted of the bottom. 

For the styling I used simple color picker to get the right colors from the original design. If I had more time I would probably try to reach som of the higher goals for example: Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters.
